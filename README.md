# Readable: A Reddit Clone React Application

This project is for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course where you will build a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This project was initially forked from the starter template found @ https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter/

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server that you'll use to develop and interact with the front-end portion of the project.
